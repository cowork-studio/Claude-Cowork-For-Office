Add as many images as possible to each document (documents starting with numbers, 
excluding the final merged document). Images can be retrieved from the web, 
diagrams can be drawn using SVG or Mermaid, 
and can also include data visualization charts generated from code. 
Images should be added based on the text content.
Images should be placed in the images folder and can be drawn by directly modifying the markdown.
After configuring images for all documents, merge the documents again.
